<p style="text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify;">
I am an <strong>assistant professor</strong> in the <strong>School of Integrated Circuits at Peking University</strong>. My research interests include <strong>emerging computing based on emerging devices</strong>, including the design and fabrication of emerging devices, the circuit and architecture design of <strong>RRAM-based CIM chips</strong>, and <strong>neuromorphic computing</strong>. I have authored <strong>over 100 scientific publications</strong> in leading international journals and conferences, such as <strong>Nature Electronics</strong>, <strong>Nature Communications</strong>, <strong>Science Advances</strong>, <strong>Advanced Materials</strong>, <strong>IEEE-IEDM</strong>, <strong>DAC</strong>, <strong>IEEE-TCAS</strong>, and <strong>IEEE-EDL</strong>. I am a recipient of the <strong>Excellent Young Scholars (NSFC 2020)</strong>, the <strong>Second Prize of Natural Science Award (Ministry of Education 2019)</strong>, and <strong>PhD Student Fellowship (IEEE EDS 2014)</strong>.
</p>

<p style="text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify;">
I am always looking for <strong>motivated undergraduate and graduate students</strong> with backgrounds in <strong>microelectronics</strong>, <strong>integrated circuits</strong>, <strong>computer science</strong>, <strong>electrical engineering</strong>, <strong>physics</strong>, or related areas working on research fields of:
</p>

1. **RRAM-based CIM chips and systems** for neural networks.
2. **Emerging devices and architectures** for data sensing, computing, and storage.
3. **Memristor-based neuromorphic computing**.
4. **Auto design tools** for emerging computing systems.

**Opening positions available:** Ph.D., Post Doc, Master
